## SpawnerSilk - Installation

Make sure you have [downloaded](https://apavarino.github.io/SpawnerSilk/download) the plugin before reading this step.

All you have to do it is to put the `SpawnerSilk-X.X.X.jar` in the `plugins` folder and start your server.

If everything goes well, you should see on the console

```
[SpawnerSilk] Enabling DeadChest vX.X.X
```

if you have any error, make sure to match the requirement. If needed, you can ask help on Discord
